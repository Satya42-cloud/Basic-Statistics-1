## Descriptive Analytics and Data Preprocessing on Sales & Discounts Dataset:
### Introduction:
This project focuses on performing descriptive analytics, visualizing data distributions, and preprocessing a Sales & Discounts dataset to prepare it for further analysis. The primary goals include analyzing numerical data, visualizing distributions, standardizing variables, and converting categorical data into a format suitable for machine learning models.

### Descriptive Analytics for Numerical Columns
#### Objective: Compute and analyze basic statistical measures.
#### Steps:
1. Load the dataset using Python's pandas library.
2. Identify numerical columns.
3. Calculate mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
4. Interpret these statistics to understand data central tendencies and variability.

### Data Visualization
#### Objective: Visualize the distribution and relationships of variables.
#### Histograms:
- Plot histograms for numerical columns.
- Analyze the distribution to identify skewness and outliers.
#### Boxplots:
- Create boxplots to detect outliers and assess the interquartile range.
- Discuss findings related to extreme values or unusual distributions.
#### Bar Charts:
- For categorical columns, create bar charts to visualize the frequency of each category.
- Analyze and interpret the distribution of categories.

### Standardization of Numerical Variables
#### Objective: Scale numerical variables to improve model performance.
#### Steps:
- Explain standardization (z-score normalization).
- Apply standardization using the formula: z= (x-mean(x))/std(x).
- Show before and after comparisons of data distributions.

### Conversion of Categorical Data into Dummy Variables
#### Objective: Transform categorical variables for machine learning compatibility.
#### Steps:
- Discuss the need for one-hot encoding.
- Apply one-hot encoding to categorical columns, creating binary columns for each category.
- Display a portion of the transformed dataset.

### Conclusion:
Summarize key findings from the descriptive analytics and visualizations. Reflect on the importance of preprocessing steps like standardization and one-hot encoding in enhancing the quality and usability of data for analysis and machine learning.
